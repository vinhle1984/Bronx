Created by Vinh Le, Mike Martos, Armand Post, Henry Boerner, Rajeev Kumar


###What:
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of R programming to format and restructure complex data sets to find insights and draw conclusion.
    Objectives:
    1. Use data-gathering makefiles to organize the data-gathering process so that the process can be completely reproduced
		2. Apply proper documentation techniques for variables and code
		3. Load data from various sources, both locally from the computer and remotely from the Internet
		4. Define tidy data
    5. Use capabilities in R to create tidy data



###Directory Structure:

####A.) Data SubFolder:- 
Data Folder has raw data i.e. source xls file and tidy csv data file. 
To view codes used in clean-up, please refer Bronx.Rmd under Analysis sub-folder.

####B.) Analysis SubFolder:- 
Analysis Folder has RMD file with R code, graphs and mark down files that are used for exploratory purposes.

####C.) FinalAnalsis SubFolder:- 
FinalAnalsis Folder has RMD file with final conclusion.

####D.) Graphs SubFolder:- 
This folder has graphs that are generated for this project.


###Variables:

For Code Book, please refer rollingsales_bronx_Data_Dictionary.csv under Data Subdirectory.


###Process:
The process for this project began with a discussion regarding the division of work.  One team member volunteered to host the Github repository where all work would be uploaded.  The repository was created and initial readme file created.  Bronx was chosen as the neighborhood and the provided .csv was assessed.  A data dictionary was created with variable descriptions and variable type for each column of the provided .csv.
Exploratory data analysis was then completed using the code provided by the professor.  Once an initial assessment of the provided code was completed, pieces were chosen for the final analysis.  While the summary data and other code was useful for the exploratory analysis, many pieces were excluded from the final analysis with the purpose of making the end result easier to follow.
Since viewing the data with all neighborhoods lumped together didnâ€™t present clear findings, it was decided that three neighborhoods would be chosen to assess separately.  Once this was completed the relationship between sales price and square footage became more apparent.
Final steps included agreeing on the final directory structure of the Github repository and cleaning up of the files within.  The readme was then expanded to include more detail regarding the analysis.


###Conclusion
Write up insights, conclusion, summary. Either have it here in the main Readme file or create another one in either of the other directory to summarize our results.
